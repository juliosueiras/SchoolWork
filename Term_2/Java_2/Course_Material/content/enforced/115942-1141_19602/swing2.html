<h3>Basic Layout Managers</h3>

<p>Later in the course, you'll learn how to make complex layouts using the
    Netbeans GUI builder.  However, in order to understand how
    layout management works, you need to learn some basic layout
    management concepts and tools.  The key thing to remember as you're
    learning about layout management is that a Java program's 
    interface needs to be <i>liquid</i>:  The screen should resize without
    the components shifting too much, it should be professional,
    user-friendly, and all components should be clearly visible no matter
    what the user's screen settings are set too (e.g. large fonts,
    high-contrast, etc).  There shouldn't be any large gaps or "whitespace"
    in your interface and you should always resize and maximize
    your interface to ensure that it always keeps its professional and
    user-friendly appearance.</p>

<a name="comp"><h3>Layout Management</h3></a>

<p>In Java, layout management helps you to lay out your components
    in a container.  Layout Managers are classes you can use to
    define how you would like a component or set of components to
    be placed in a container.  Layout managers generally work by
    dividing a container into cells or areas.  Each cell of a layout
    has a preferred height and width, and components that are placed
    into cells will often be resized to fit with other components in
    other cells.  For this reason, we often combine layout managers:
    You might place a label and text field pair into one container,
    laid out so that they are placed together.  You might then do
    this to similar pairs of labels and text fields.  Then you might
    place each of these label/text field containers into a container
    that lines them up in rows.</p>

<p>Container classes (such as the content pane and panels, which 
    we'll learn about shortly) have a setLayout() method that
    accepts a Layout object as an argument.  This layout object
    is assigned to the container and will affect how objects are
    placed when you put them into the container.</p>

<a name="flow"><h3>FlowLayout</h3></a>

<p>FlowLayout is one of the more basic layout classes and
    it is part of the java.awt package.  FlowLayout likes to keep
    its components in a row.  If it runs to the edge of the screen,
    it will wrap to the next line and place the rest of the components
    on the next row.  Its preferred height is the height of the tallest
    item in the row plus whatever vertical gap size you set for it.
    Its preferred width is the sum of the widths of all its components
    plus any horizontal gap space you place between components and the
    end of the row.</p>

<h4>FlowLayout Constructors:</h4>

<ul class="outer">
	<li><font face="Courier New">FlowLayout(int align)</font> 
            - takes one integer argument that indicates how the
            components in the container should be aligned.
            Possible values are FlowLayout.LEFT, FlowLayout.RIGHT,
            and FlowLayout.CENTER.
	<li><font face="Courier New">FlowLayout(int align, int vGap,
                int hGap)</font> - takes an integer argument for alignment,
                an integer argument for the size of any vertical gap space
                you'd like between components and the top and bottom of
                the container, and another integer argument for the size
                of any horizontal gap space you'd like between components,
                and between the components and the ends of the container.
                The vertical and horizontal gap space is measured in pixels.
</ul>

<p>Try this out.  Create a new Swing interface with 4 buttons
    (whatever text you like).  Set the layout of the content pane to a
    left-aligned FlowLayout and vertical & horizontal gap space of 5
    pixels.  Add your buttons to the content pane.</p>

<p>Try out your interface to see how it appears.  Try making the following
    changes:</p>
<ul class="outer">
	<li>Try it with right alignment; try it with center alignment.
	<li>Try it with a vGap and hGap of 0.  Try with a vGap and hGap of 20.
	<li>What happens when you resize the frame with the different
            alignment settings?
</ul>


<a name="grid"><h3>GridLayout</h3></a>

<p>GridLayout uses a grid, or rows and columns, to lay out components:  
    It will add components one row at a time, going left to right,
    then continue with the next row.  GridLayout will stretch all
    components to be of equal size in the grid, so the preferred size
    of a particular cell will be the height and width of the largest
    component in the layout.  One other important thing about GridLayout
    is that you can only place one component into a cell.</p>

<h4>GridLayout Constructors:</h4>

<ul class="outer">
	<li><font face="Courier New">GridLayout(int numRows, int numCols)</font> - Takes two integer values representing the number of rows and columns the grid should have.  If you place a 0 in one of these values, it makes one dimension of the layout dynamic.  For example, if you specify 2 rows and 0 columns, the grid will always contain two rows, regardless of the number of components (it will add columns in order to keep the two rows).
	<li><font face="Courier New">GridLayout(int numRows, int numColumns,
                int vGap, int hGap)</font> - in addition to the number
                of rows and columns, also specifies the amount of space
                (vertically and horizontally) to place between each
                component and the border of its cell.  Gap space is
                measured in pixels.
</ul>

<p>Try it out:  Change the layout of your content pane to a GridLayout
    with 2 rows, 2 columns, and 5 pixels of vertical and horizontal gap space.  What happens as you resize the frame?</p>

<p>Try the following changes:  </p>
<ul class="outer">
	<li>Change the order in which you add the buttons to the content pane.
	<li>Change the number of rows to 3 and the number of columns to 2.
        <li>Change the number of rows to 2 and the number of columns to 3.
	<li>Change the number of rows to 1 and the number of columns to 0.
	<li>Change the number of rows to 0 and the number of columns to 3.
</ul>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p>Create the following interface:</p>
<p><img src="images/sess2-3_ex1.jpg"></p>

<a name="border"><h3>BorderLayout</h3></a>

<p>BorderLayout divides your container into 5 areas labeled "North", "South",
"East", "West", and "Center".  This looks like a pretty useless layout manager
but it's actually very useful when you combine it with other layout managers.</p>

<p>As with GridLayout, you can only place one component in the cell of a
    BorderLayout.  In addition, when you add a component to a container
    with a BorderLayout, you must include a second argument to the add()
    method that specifies which cell the component must go in.  For example:</p>

<pre>add(cmdExit, BorderLayout.SOUTH);</pre>

<p>This places the component cmdExit into the South cell of the
    BorderLayout.  Possible values are BorderLayout.SOUTH,
    BorderLayout.NORTH, BorderLayout.EAST, BorderLayout.WEST, and
    BorderLayout.CENTER.</p>

<p>The preferred size for a cell in a BorderLayout depend on which
    position your component is in:</p>

<ul class="outer">
	<li>NORTH and SOUTH:  The preferred height of the North and
            South cells are the height of the component contained in
            the cell.  These cells' preferred width is whatever they
            can get, so they will stretch as much as they can to the
            left and right, limited only by the width of the window.
	<li>EAST and WEST:  The preferred width of the East and West 
            cells is the width of the component contained in the cell.
            These cells' preferred height is whatever they can get, so
            they will stretch as much as they can up and down, limited
            only by the height of the window.
	<li>CENTER:  This cell will take up whatever space it can get.
            What ever height is not taken by North and South, and
            whatever width is not taken by East and West, will be
            taken up by the Center.  In other words, Center will take
            up any left over space, so its preferred size is whatever
            it can get.
</ul>

<h4>BorderLayout Constructors:</h4>

<ul class="outer">
	<li><font face="Courier New">BorderLayout()</font> - creates
            a BorderLayout object.
	<li><font face="Courier New">BorderLayout(int vGap, int hGap)</font>
            - specifies the amount of space (vertically and horizontally)
            to place between each component and the border of its cell.
            Gap space is measured in pixels.
</ul>

<p>Try it:  Add a fifth button to your interface and place all five
    buttons into cells of a BorderLayout.</p>

<h3>Complex Layouts</h3>

<p>Most of your layouts won't use only one layout manager.  It's possible to create complex layouts by combining two or more layout managers
in different containers (panels).  This section will give you the tools and concepts needed to create more advanced layouts using the basic
layout managers learned previously.  Note that there are other, more sophisticated layout managers available:  you might wish to explore
these on your own.  See the link at the top of this page for Sun's Layout Manager tutorials for more information.</p>


<a name="pack"><h3>Using the pack() Method</h3></a>

<p>One of the more difficult parts of writing the constructor for your
interface is knowing what size your frame should be.  You can eliminate
this confusing decision by using the pack() method of the JFrame object.
This method calculates the preferred size of components and containers and
adds them together, then uses this information to pack the components together
and set the size of the frame.</p>

<p>Try it out so you can see the difference.  In your previous examples,
comment out the setSize() method and add the pack() method, before
setVisible().</p>

<a name="nest"><h3>Nesting Layouts</h3></a>

<p>In many of the examples we did in the previous session, you noticed that
when you resize your frames, the components shift position, wrap around to a
new line, or change size.  You can eliminate this behavior by using nested
flow layouts.  You will also often combine layouts in order to get a specific
look to your interface.  We combine layouts by creating Panel objects (these
are just another type of container, but they are invisible to the user, so
they're perfect for programming interfaces).  We can assign a layout to a
panel, and then add that panel to another container.  Doing this with many
panels means you can combine layouts.  Sometimes we call this "nesting
layouts" because we are placing one panel (with a particular layout) inside
another container (with another layout).  For example, the following interface
uses nested layouts:</p>

<p><img src="images/sess2-1_interface.jpg"></p>

<p>To make use of nested layout managers, we often create one or more JPanel
objects.  A JPanel is just a simple container that is invisible to the user,
but it includes the setLayout() method so you can give it any layout you
want.  You can also give the JPanel it's layout manager object in the
constructor, if you prefer.  JPanel also has the add() method so you can
add components to a panel.  Other than that, there is little functionality
in JPanel, it simply contains other components (including other JPanel
objects).</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to create a panel that contained two buttons
in a 1-by-2 grid, I might type code such as:</p>

<pre>JButton cmdSearch = new JButton("Search");
JButton cmdExit = new JButton("Exit");
JPanel pnlButtons = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1, 2));
pnlButtons.add(cmdSearch);
pnlButtons.add(cmdExit);</pre>

<p>A JPanel is a container, and a component, so you can place the panel
pnlButtons into another container that is only allowed to contain one object.
For example, recall that in GridLayouts and BorderLayouts, a cell can only
contain one component.  If I want these two buttons to go into the SOUTH
cell of a BorderLayout, I can just put pnlButtons in the SOUTH cell:</p>

<pre>this.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
this.add(pnlButtons, BorderLayout.SOUTH);</pre>

<p>When you are designing an interface that has multiple and nested layout
managers, it's a good idea to sketch the interface on paper and see if you
can figure out where the layouts lie.  Try these examples for practice:</p>

<p><img src="images/sess3-1_layout1.jpg"></p>

<p><img src="images/sess3-1_layout2.jpg"></p>

<p><img src="images/sess3-1_layout3.jpg"></p>

<div class="puzzle"><b>Resizable?</b><br>
Your panels and components will often resize and shift when the user resizes
a frame.  To prevent the user from resizing a frame, use the
setResizable(false) method on your JFrame object.  You can also prevent
panels and components from resizing by placing them into FlowLayouts.</div>

<h4>Exercise</h3>

<p>Create the Address Book interface shown near the beginning of this
section.</p>

<a name="size"><h3>Setting Component Sizes</h3></a>

<p>You will notice that you haven't have much control over the size of
your components when you use certain layout managers.  This is because a
component's preferred size becomes the preferred size of it's cell or
container.  You can change this in some cases by using a component's
<b>setPreferredSize() method</b>.</p>

<p>the setPreferredSize() method takes a <b>Dimension object</b>.  A
Dimension object's constructor takes an int value for width and an int
value for height.  For example, the following statement will set a
JButton's preferred size to 100 x 25 pixels:</p>

<pre>cmdExit.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(100, 25));</pre>
