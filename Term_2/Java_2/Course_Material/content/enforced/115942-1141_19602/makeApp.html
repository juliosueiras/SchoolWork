<h2>Application Deployment - Making an Install File</h2>

<p><a href="files/Deployment.ppt">Download the slides</a> for this lesson.</p>

<p>Once you've completed (created, tested, and
debugged) an application, you might be ready to
deploy it.  Deployment in Netbeans is relatively
easy!  You might want to re-read the lesson on
<a href="http://www-acad.sheridanc.on.ca/~jollymor/prog24178/library.html#jar">Creating a Jar File</a>
before you proceed with this lesson.</p>

<p>To deploy a program, you just collect all the files
required to run your program and put them into a single
install file, such as a ZIP or RAR (those who are very
familiar with these utilties can even make self-extracting
files!)  To create your Install File, just perform the
following steps:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create a JAR</h3>

<p>The first step is to create a JAR file for your
project.  Just right-click the project node and
select "Clean and Build" once you've set the
properties for your jar file (see previous
<a href="http://www-acad.sheridanc.on.ca/~jollymor/prog24178/library.html#jar">Creating a Jar File</a>
lesson).</p>

<p>When you create a JAR file for an application,
Netbeans will update the Manifest.mf file to indicate
which class is the "start-up" or main() class. The JAR
will also include any libraries you've added to the
project's Libraries node.</p>

<p>Once you're JAR file has been created, you should
check your project's "dist" folder and see what's there:</p>

<p><img src="images/deployDistDir.jpg" /></p>

<p>Notice the README.TXT file - you can read this
if you like, as it contains information about how to
run your jar file.  You might wish to edit this file
if there's anything important your user needs to know
about installing or using your application.</p>

<p>You'll also see a "lib" folder.  When you made
your JAR, Netbeans created this folder and added your
project's libraries (anything in your Libraries folder)
to it.  This ensures that your library code used in
this project is included in the application.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b>  If your project contains multiple classes with a
    main() method, you'll need to configure your project properties and
    make sure the manifest is updated with the name of the startup
    form or class (the one with the main() method that starts
    your program):</p>

<p><img src="images/setMainClass.png" alt="set main class configuration" /></p>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click on your main project node in the Projects
        window.</li>
    <li>Select Properties.</li>
    <li>In the Project Properties window, select the category
    "Run".</li>
    <li>In the second field, titled "Main Class"  see if your
        startup class/window is already set.  If not, click
        the Browse button.</li>
    <li>Select your startup class/window from the list, then
    click the "Select Main Class" button.</li>
    <li>Click OK to clear the Project Properties window.</li>
</ol>

<p>Check that when you "Clean and Build", your JAR file executes
    with the proper startup window/class.</p>

<h3>Step 2:  Add Additional Files/Directories</h3>

<p>If your project includes data files, images, and
other important files, you should include these in
your dist folder.  Just copy them over.</p>

<p>You can see in the image shown earlier that the
main project had a "data" folder and an "images"
folder.  Copy these folders into your "dist"
directory:</p>

<p><img src="images/deployAddExtras.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Step 3: Archive Your Project for Distribution</h3>

<p>The last step is to archive your project for
distribution.  This simply involves taking all the
files and folders in the "dist" directory and adding
them to a ZIP or RAR file.  Do not include
the "dist" folder, just the files it contains.  Also,
make sure when you create your archive, you configure
it so that the sub-directories (like "lib") are added
"as is".  The steps below take you through this
process using WinZIP:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select all your files in the "dist" folder.
    <li>Right-click the selected files and select "WinZip",
    then "Add to Zip file.."</li>
    <p><img src="images/deployAddToZip.jpg" /></p>
    <li>Pick a location on your computer, or just use the default
    location for your zip file (shown in image below)
    and add a name for your file.  This should be
    the name of your application (example below if for an
    app called "Bibs' Book Tracker").</li>
    <li>Make sure the "Save full path info" check box is
    <b>unchecked</b>.
    <li>Click the Add button to create the archive file.
</ol>
<p><img src="images/deployConfigZip.jpg" /></p>
<p>You should now see a list of the contents of your archive,
similar to the example shown in the image below:</p>

<p><img src="images/deployZipped.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can now close WinZip.  Locate your project .zip file:
you will likely need to add it to another archive or file
for your final submission.</p>

<p><b><i>HINT:</i></b> Have a friend help you test your program:
Put the install file on their computer, unpack the contents, and
then try to run the program! (make sure they have a JRE installed!)</p>

<p>You should find these steps
are similar when using WinRAR.</p>
