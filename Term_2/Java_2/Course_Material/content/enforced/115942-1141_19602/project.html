<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>This project is worth 10% of your final mark and consolidates all of the things you've learned this term. It also gives you the option of learning about something new that wasn't covered in the course.</p>
<p><b>Proposal Due Date: Week 8 (Friday, March 8, 2013 by 1pm)</b></p>
<p><b>Project Due Date: Week 14 (Friday, April 12, 2013 by end of day)</b></p>
<p><b>Last Date for Late Projects: (Monday, April 15, 2013 - subject to penalty)</b></p>
<h3>Project Specs</h3>
<p>Write a program that uses a GUI to allow the user to view records in a file. You decide what you want to keep track of (media such as book/movie/cd collection, inventory in a store, members of a group or organization, etc). Your program must include the following:</p>
<ul class="outer">
<li>A file that contains records used in your program (you can use a sequential file or a random access file).
<ul class="inner">
<li>Use a sequential file if you are going to be adding records and read them back sequentially. You can also use a sequential file to perform searches that will need to iterate through the entire file.</li>
<li>Use a random access file if you are going to be adding and editing records, or going directly to specific records (for example, by allowing a user to select a record by clicking on something in a list box).</li>
<li>Deleting records is cumbersome in both kinds of files. However, if you're allowing the user to delete, then obviously you're also allowing edits. In this case, you'd want to use a random access file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A class that models a record in your file. For example, if your file contains book information with the fields ISBN, Title, and Author, then you will need a Book class with data members for ISBN, Title, and Author (and other appropriate code and members).</li>
<li>A class that models the list of records, using an ArrayList (or other Collections class) of record objects (e.g. I might have BookList class of Book objects). This class will perform operations such as adding and removing record objects, replacing modifed record objects, etc.</li>
<li>A class that contains the GUI for your program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your user should be able to navigate records in some manner. For example, you can have First/Previous/Next/Last buttons on your screen that allows the user to move from record to record. You could have a list box that lists one or two main fields from the file, and clicking or double-clicking an item in the list looks up the rest of the data and displays it on the screen.</p>
<p>You should also provide some way for the user to view or search for records (e.g. allow the user to select an author from a list box to search for all books by that author). You decide. You will get more marks for things that are more complicated or sophisticated. For example, simply displaying the records sequentially in file order is very basic; displaying only those records that meet a certain criteria is a bit more complicated; displaying records in alphabetical order by some field requires a lot more thought and would be worth much more than the previous two examples.</p>
<p>You must also provide the ability to add, edit, and delete records, in a professional and user-friendly manner. This must also include things like proper data validation (a lot of this will be handled by your record object class, yes?)</p>
<p>We will be doing various small assignments and exercises in class that demonstrate many of the project components. It will be up to you to assemble these parts into a functional application.</p>
<p><a name="proposal"></a></p>
<h3>Having your Project Approved</h3>
<p><b><span color="red" style="color: red;">You must submit a <b>project proposal</b> in order to receive any marks for your final project submission. Projects submitted without an on-time proposal will be given a grade of 0.</span></b></p>
<p>The proposal must contain the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A title page containing:
<ul class="inner">
<li>Your full name and student number.</li>
<li>Your full program name (e.g. Systems Analyst, Computer Science Technology)</li>
<li>The title of your proposed application (e.g. DVD Inventory System)</li>
<li>The date you submitted the proposal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A description of your proposed project in proper paragraph form with correct spelling and grammar. This paragraph should answer the following questions:
<ul class="inner">
<li>What kind of data are you keeping track of?</li>
<li>Who is the project intended for; who is the user?</li>
<li>Why is this a useful application? What purpose does this application serve?</li>
<li>What are the main features and functions of your application?</li>
<li>Anything else you feel you need to say in order to describe your proposed application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A file description that list the description and data type of each field.</li>
<li>
<ul class="inner">
<li>This must be done in proper chart form as shown in the example below.</li>
</ul>
<!--<li>A UML class diagram that describes your record object class and your list class.</li>-->
<p>Example: the chart below describes the format of records in a file that tracks information about bottles of wine:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="3"><b>File: </b> wine.dat</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>Description</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>wine i.d.</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>uniquely identfies a bottle of wine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>estate</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>the name of the place that made the wine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>grape</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>the type of grape e.g. chardonnay</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>year</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>the year the wine was made</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>price</td>
<td>double</td>
<td>the wine's current value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>qty</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>the number of bottles I own</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Screen designs or sketches, either done by hand or with a tool such as Visio, Microsft Word, or other graphics/charting software
<ul class="inner">
<li>Your screen designs might change as you develop your program, but they shouldn't change drastically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A description of any introductory research you might need to do about any additional classes/packages or concepts you might need to learn about in order to develop your program.</li>
</ol>
<p>A hard copy of this proposal is due at the date/time specified by your professor. <b><span color="red" style="color: red;">Emailed submissions will not be accepted.</span></b> If you are unable to drop off your proposal on the due date, you may submit the hard copy earlier. <b>Late submissions will not be accepted and will result in a project grade of 0</b>.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Evaluation of this assignment is based on:</p>
<ul class="outer">
<li>Interface design - neat, professional, user-friendly, easy to use and not confusing or ambiguous, gives good feedback (e.g. error messages, instructions).</li>
<li>Program functionality - does it work properly? Does anything make it crash? Does it meet the program requirements?</li>
<li>Quality of Code - code is easy to read and interpret, good spacing and indentation, proper and complete documentation, efficient use of program control structures, appropriate method and variable names, efficient code that is not redundant or unstructured, use of constants instead of literals where appropriate, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest part of the evaluation is the program's functionality. The program should not crash under any circumstances or an automatic grade of 0 is assigned. This means you need to thoroughly debug your program and ensure that your interface is mistake-proof! Your program should also include professional and user-friendly feedback (e.g. instructions, error messages) and there should be no ambiguous elements to your program. If necessary, you may be asked to demonstrate your program to the instructor.</p>
<p>Each class/program must be fully documented, including programmer identification (see <a href="http://www-acad.sheridanc.on.ca/~jollymor/prog24178/submissions.html">submission standards</a> for more information).</p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p><b>Documentation:</b></p>
<p>You must include proper javadoc comments for all classes in your project, although they are not required for your GUI class. So any libraries you've written and the classes you wrote that aren't GUI classes should all include correct javadoc documentation.</p>
<p>You DO NOT need to compile and include the javadoc files in your project. Just make sure you have the complete and correctly formatted javadoc comments in your code.</p>
<p>You must ZIP or RAR all of the required files (see below) into one submission file. <b><i>Read this carefully! If you do not follow the instructions properly, you will lose marks</i></b>.</p>
<p>Your submission file must include:</p>
<ol>
<li>An "install file" (see <a href="makeApp.html">Application Deployment</a> for instructions on how to create a simple Install File for a Java app). <b>This file must be a zip/rar file.</b>Your install file must include the contents of your DIST folder (but not the DIST folder itself):<ol type="a">
<li><b>Your project's JAR (executable) file</b>. If you set up your project and JAR properly, it should automatically include any libraries that you added to your project, and all the classes that make up your project.</li>
<li>Any <b>data files</b>used by your project (be sure to use relative file/path references in your project and that your data files are in the right location relative to your project!) Be sure your data file contains enough variety of data for me to test your project, if applicable.</li>
<li>Any <b>other files/directories</b>(e.g. images - also make sure all references are relative and that these files/directories are in the right location relative to your project)</li>
<li>If I require <b>information in order to run/test your program</b>, (e.g. cool things you want to make sure I see, any login information I need, sample data you want me to try (otherwise I'll just make up stuff ;) ), or any other important information/instructions, then type up this information and put it in a <b>README.TXT</b> file in the project root (e.g. in the same location as your executable)</li>
</ol>
<p>This file should be a meaningful name for your project with "INSTALL" somewhere in it. For example, <b>"BibsBookTracker_INSTALL.zip"</b>.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Your Netbeans project directory.</b> As usual, just zip/rar your entire project directory into one file.</li>
<li>
<p>This file should have a meaningful name for your project with "SOURCE" or "SRC" in it. For example, <b>"BibsBookTracker_SRC.zip"</b>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Combine both of your zip/rar files into another zip/rar file.</b></p>
<p>The name of this file should be <b><span face="Courier New" style="font-family: 'Courier New';">loginName_project.zip</span></b> or <b><span face="Courier New" style="font-family: 'Courier New';">loginName_project.rar</span></b> where "loginName" is <b><i>your Sheridan user name</i></b>.</p>
<p>Be sure to read the above information carefully! Your final submission file will contain all your java source/form files and also an install ZIP/RAR file!</p>
<p>Submit your final submission in the appropriate Drop Box.</p>
