<h4>Why Use Arrays?</h4>

<p>A variable can hold only one value at any given time.  This isn't really a problem in most of our programs, since we usually declare as many variables as we need to store values.  However, sometimes this can be a limitation that causes problems in your program solutions.  An example can be a program that records grades for a set of four courses and displays only those courses that are above the average:</p>

<pre>int NUM_COURSES = 4
double grade1 = 0
double grade2 = 0
double grade3 = 0
double grade4 = 0
double totalGrade = 0
double avgGrade = 0
Print "Enter first grade: "
Get grade1
Print "Enter second grade: "
Get grade2
Print "Enter third grade: "
Get grade3
Print "Enter fourth grade: "
Get grade4
avgGrade = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4) / NUM_COURSES
Print "Average:  ", avgGrade
Print "Grades above average:"
If grade1 > avgGrade Then
	Print "Grade #1: ", grade1
If grade2 > avgGrade Then
	Print "Grade #2: ", grade2
If grade3 > avgGrade Then
	Print "Grade #3: ", grade3
If grade4 > avgGrade Then
	Print "Grade #4: ", grade4
</pre>

<p>This code segment gets the four course grades as input from the
user and, after obtaining all four grades, the calculates and
displays the average of the four grades.</p>

<p>This simple solution works fine, but what if you wanted to use
the same program to calculate another student's average with six
courses?  What if you wanted to work this program for all your
courses in your entire program upon graduation?  You would have
to keep adding extra variables each time you wanted to run the
program with a different number of courses.  As a deployable
program, this is not an option:  You can't expect your users to
alter the programming code whenever they want to enter a different
number of grades.</p>

<h4>Array Concepts</h4>

<p>Arrays help solve this problem.  An array is similar to a
variable, except that it can hold more than one value.  An array is
made up of a set of "slots" or <b>elements</b>, where each element
holds one value.  For example, an array with 4 elements can hold
four different values:</p>

<p><img src="images/sess2-1_array.jpg" align="left" hspace=10 vspace=10>To access an element of an array, whether to place a value in the array or read a value from the array, you need to specify which of the elements you want to access.  For example, do you want to place a new value in the third element or do you want to print the value in the last element?  You identify the element by its <b>index</b> or <b>subscript</b>.  The element's index is its position or slot number in the array.  For example, in our grades array above, the value 75.0 is element #2.</p>

<p>In Java, array indexes always start at 0, so the first element in
the array actually has an index or subscript of 0, the second
element has a subscript of 1, and so on.  The length, or number of
elements, in the array is always one more than the highest index
value.  For example, the grades array has a length of 4 and its
highest index value is 3.  The grades array's first index value
is 0.</p>

<p><b><a href="javascript:window.alert(q1);">Question:</a></b>  What
is the length of an array who's indexes go from 0 to 10?</p>

<a name="code"><h3>Coding With Arrays</h3></a>

<p>To use an array in Java, you have to declare or define it, just
as you would with any other variable.  The difference is that you
have to use the square brackets [] to show that you are declaring
an array:</p>

<pre>double[] grades;</pre>

<p><img src="images/sess2-1_arrayMem.jpg"></p>

<p>This statement declares an array called "grades" that will hold a
set of double values.  This array variable is currently not pointing
to anything; the variable is not really empty, it just hasn't been
given an array yet.  In other words, we have not yet allocated
storage for the array; we've only just indicated that this variable
will eventually point to an array of double values.</p>

<div class="puzzle">An array can only hold one kind of data.  You
can't declare an array that holds, for example, ints and Strings,
or doubles and ints.  An array has to be all ints, or all doubles,
or all Strings, or all of whatever type of data or object is
appropriate.</div>

<p>To create the array and allocate storage for the array, you need
to specify the type of data the array will hold, and the length, or
number of elements, in the array.  This next statement creates and
allocates storage for an array of 10 double values, and assigns that
array to the grades array variable:</p>

<pre>grades = new double[10];</pre>

<p>This grades array will have indexes from 0 to 9, because we have
defined it to have 10 elements.  If we wanted to, we could have
declared the array variable and allocated storage for the array in
one statement:</p>

<pre>double[] grades = new double[10];</pre>

<p>In this case, we've created an empty array of doubles with
storage for 10 elements and stored a reference to that array in the
variable grades.</p>

<p>Whether you declare the variable and create the array in one
statement or in two statements depends on the nature of your program.
If you happen to know how many elements the array will need, you can
declare it and allocate storage for it right away.  However, this
won't always be the case, as we'll see with some of our examples in
the next few sessions.</p>

<div class="puzzle">Note that the statement
<font face="Courier New">double[] grades = new double[10];</font>
only creates the array object.  It does not place any values into
the array.  When an array is created for any of Java's primitive
types, each element is automatically initialzed to that type's null
value. If you want any other value to be stored in the array, it is
up to you to write the code to do that.</div>

<p>To access an array in Java, you specify the subscript or index
in the square brackets:</p>

<pre>// stores values in all the elements
grades[0] = 89.2;
grades[1] = 75.0;
grades[2] = 69.8;
grades[3] = 85.5;
// prints the value in the third element:
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, <font color="red">"Grade #3: " +
grades[2]</font>,
	"Grade", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);</pre>

<a name="ex1"></a>
<h4>Exercises</h4>

<p><b>1. </b> Do each of the following exercises in your textbook
    on page 225:  6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8</p>

<p><b>2. </b> For each of the following, declare an array with an
appropriate name and type and allocate an appropriate amount of
storage.</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>a list of grades for 100 courses
	<li>A list of 10 names
	<li>a list of 50 temperatures
	<li>a list birth years for 25 club members
	<li>a list of product IDs (product IDs can include digits,
    letters, and the dash (-)
	<li>a list that keeps track of the numbers of students in 5 
    different classes (e.g. class 1 has x students, class 2 has y
    students, etc)
</ol>

<p><b>3. </b> Fill in the elements for the
<font face="Courier New">values[]</font> array (it has 10 elements)
as the following code executes:</p>

<pre>int counter = 1;
values[0] = 10;
values[counter] = counter;
counter++;
values[5] = counter;
values[9] = values[5] + counter;
values[counter] = values[9] - values[1];
values[9] += ++counter;</pre>

<p>Array: values[10]<br>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Arrays are useful when you want to process a list of data, such
as a list of grades.  If you wanted to total or sum the grades in
the list, you might think to add all the array elements together:</p>

<pre>totalGrade = grades[0] + grades[1] + grades[2] + grades[3];</pre>

<p>This works, but what if your array had 10 elements?  What if
your array had 100 elements?  There is a more efficient way of
performing operations on every element in an array: use a loop.</p>

<p>Loops work well when processing an array because you can start
at element 0 and repeatedly perform an operation on every element
in the array until you get to the last element.  To make this work,
you need to know the length of your array and you need a counter
(or just use a for loop):</p>

<pre>for (int i=0; i&lt;grades.length; i++)
	totalGrade += grades[i];</pre>

<p>Notice that in the loop, my loop condition is
<font face="Courier New">i&lt;grades.length</font>.  An array
contains a public attribute called "length" which always contains
the number of elements in the array.  Do not confuse this with a
String object's length() method!  These are not the same thing!
grades.length is referring to the value in the length attribute of
the grades array.</p>

<p>The statement <font face="Courier New">totalGrade +=
grades[i];</font> is accumulating the grades from each element in
the array.  For the first iteration of the for-loop, the counter i
is 0, so in this case, the compiler would be
<font face="Courier New">totalGrade += grades[0];</font>.  For the
second iteration of the array, the counter i is 1, so the compiler
would read <font face="Courier New">totalGrade += grades[1];</font>.
For the third iteration of the array, the counter i is 2, so the
compiler would read <font face="Courier New">totalGrade +=
grades[2];</font>, and for the last iteration, the counter i is 3
so the compiler would read <font face="Courier New">totalGrade +=
grades[3];</font>.  After this, the counter is incremented to 4.
The condition states that the loop terminates when the counter i is
no longer less than grades.length (which has a value of 4).  Since
the counter i's value of 4 is no longer less than the grades.length
value of 4, the loop ends.  At this point, totalGrade holds the sum
of all the elements in the array.</p>

<p><b>4. </b> Do exercise 6.9 on page 225 of your textbook.</p>

<a name="foreach"></a>
<h3>The For-Each Loop</h3>
<h4>Section 6.2.7 in your textbook</h4>

<p>The for-each loop is available in many languages, including
Java, although its syntax varies.  The for-each loop is a for-loop
that was created specifically to iterate through arrays and other
collection objects.  The general syntax is:</p>

<pre>for (arrayDataType element: arrayVariable) {
     // refer to this element as "element"
}</pre>

<p>Here, arrayDataType is the data type of the array you'd like
to process.<br />
"element" is the variable that holds the current array element
value for each iteration.</p>
<p>Together, arrayDataType element is a declaration for a temporary
    variable that is local to the for-each loop.  This variable
    will always contain the current element's value.</p>
<p>After the colon, you place the name of the array you're
    iterating through.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>for (double g: grades) {
     System.out.println(g);
}</pre>

<p>In this example, we iterate through each element in the grades
array and print the element values on the screen.</p>

<p>Note that with a for-each loop, you can only READ from the
array, you can't write to the array.</p>

<h4>Programming Exercises</h4>

<p><b>1. </b>Write the code to display the
<font face="Courier New">values[]</font> array (from the previous
exercise) backwards.</p>

<p><b>2.a. </b>Write a program that uses a char[] array to store
the characters in a sentence.  Ask the user for a sentence, and
then store that string into the char[] array.</p>

<p><b>2.b </b>Modify the above program to do a search/replace for
one letter in the char[] array.  Ask the user what letter they'd
like to replace, and then the letter they'd like to replace it with.
After doing the search/replace, display the sentence.</p>

<p><b>3. </b>Record 10 integer values from the user and store them
in an array.  After recording the 10 values, calculate and display:

<ul class="outer">
	<li>The average
	<li>The highest value
	<li>The lowest value
</ul>

<p><b>4. </b>Find out how often the numbers from 1 to 10 are
generated randomly.  Declare an array to hold 10 integer elements.
Generate 100 random numbers from 1 to 10 inclusive, and use the
array to keep track of how many times each number occurs.  For
example, if the first number generated is 9, add 1 to the 9th
element of the array.  If the second number generated is 3, add
1 to the 3rd element of the array.  If the third number generated
is 9, add another 1 to the 9th element of the array.  After 100
numbers have been generated, each element of the array will hold
the number of times that value was generated.  Display the array.</p>

<p>In this example, we're using the array as a <b>frequency
table</b> to keep track of the frequency of each of the 10
numbers.</p>

<p><b>5. </b>A small school is keeping track of the number of cans
recycled for it's grade 1, 2, and 3 classes.  Each time students
bring in cans, the number of cans are counted and added to the
total for that student's class or grade.</p>

<p>Use an array to keep track of the totals for each of the three
grades (therefore, the array should have 3 elements).  The user
will be repeatedly prompted to enter the grade number, and the
number of cans brought by a student, until they decide to quit.
For each number of cans entered, add that number to the total for
that grade (e.g. the proper array element).</p>

<p>After the user is finished entering data, display the totals
for the three grades.</p>

<p><b>6. </b>Ask the user to enter five integer values.  Store
the values in an array and then determine if the values were
entered in ascending order.  Display a message indicating whether
they are sorted or not.</p>

<p><b>7. </b> Do each of the following programming exercises
    on pages 227-228 of your textbook:  6.2, 6.3.</p>
