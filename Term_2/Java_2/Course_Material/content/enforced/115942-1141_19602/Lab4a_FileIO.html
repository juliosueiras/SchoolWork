<h1>Lab 4(a):&nbsp; LDAP Directory Structure</h1>
<h2>Due: Friday, March 15, 2013 @ 10am</h2>
<h3>About this lab</h3>
<p>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, or LDAP, is an application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Intenet Protocol (IP) network.&nbsp; It is used to identify members of the directory, by their name, organization, and other distinguishing factors, and to arrange those factors in a tree-like structure.</p>
<p>LDAP is one of the most commonly used protocols in today's business for maintaining user security information.&nbsp; Many network security products use LDAP structures in their architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A typical LDAP structure starts at the root, the organization (characterized with the symbol 'o').&nbsp; The organization is broken in to different organizational units ('ou').&nbsp; The organizational units may be composed of users with IDs ('uid') and by named groups, or common names ('cn').&nbsp; For example,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cn=swanma ou=trafalgar o=sheridan</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cn=wangj uid=99221 ou=davis o=sheridan</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">cn=wangj uid=98765 ou=trafalgar o=sheridan</span></p>
<h3>Part 1: Instructions</h3>
<p>Write a class which will read and write user LDAP records from and to a text file.&nbsp; Your code must do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Java class to test writing to a <strong>text</strong> file.</li>
<li>The Java class must contain a main() method.</li>
<li>Use the console (System.in) and a Scanner to take in the target file name (ie, the file to which you will write).</li>
<li>If the file does not exist in the path, create a new file with the target name.&nbsp; Otherwise use the target file name.</li>
<li>Write a method which writes sample LDAP records in to the file as text (note: you may hardcode the records).</li>
<li>Once the the records have been written, write a method which reads the sample LDAP records from the file, removes the LDAP tags (ie, cn=), and prints the results to the console window.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Instructions</h3>
<p>Write another class which will read and write user LDAP records to and from a binary file.&nbsp; Your code must do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create another Java class to test writing to a <strong>binary</strong> file.</li>
<li>The Java class must contain a main() method.</li>
<li>Use the console (System.in) and a Scanner to take in the target file name.</li>
<li>Use the DataOutputStream class to write sample LDAP records in to the file (note: you may hardcode the records).</li>
<li>Use the DataInputStream class to read sample LDAP records from the same file</li>
<li>Display the contents of the file, field by field, in the console output (System.out).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit two classes</li>
<li>Each class must have a main() method</li>
<li>Each class must have two methods - one to read and one to write</li>
<li>Each class must use a Scanner to take in the target file name from the console input.</li>
<li>Each class must use proper file input/output techniques to read and write from/to a file.&nbsp; e.g., close, flush, etc.</li>
</ul>
