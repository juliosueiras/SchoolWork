<h1>Lab 4(b):&nbsp; Object I/O</h1>
<h2>Due: Monday, March 18, 2013 @ 11am</h2>
<h3>About this lab</h3>
<p>In the second part of the input/output assignment, you will use Object input and output streams to write whole objects to a file and read them back.</p>
<h3>Part 1: Build the model</h3>
<p>Write a serializable class, called UserRegistration, which will be read from and written to an external file.&nbsp; Your code must do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a class called UserRegistration.</li>
<li>The class must implement the Serializable interface.</li>
<li>The class must contain basic user registration fields: &nbsp;a username (String), a user ID (int), the user's first name and last name (Strings), a password (String), and an email address (String)</li>
<li>Build a constructor for the class which will, at minimum, set the username, userID, and password.</li>
<li>Build getters and setters for all fields except the password. &nbsp;Password has a setter, no getter.</li>
<li>The password must be transient.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Build a class to read/write</h3>
<p>Write another class which will read and write user registration records to and from a binary file.&nbsp; Your code must do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create another Java class to test writing to a&nbsp;<strong>binary</strong>&nbsp;file.</li>
<li>The Java class must contain a main() method.</li>
<li>Use the console (System.in) and a Scanner to take in the target file name.</li>
<li>Use the console and a Scanner to take in the user registration information: &nbsp;remember that username, user ID and password are mandatory. &nbsp;The other fields are not.</li>
<li>Use the ObjectOutputStream class to write sample user registration records in to a file.</li>
<li>Use the ObjectInputStream class to read sample records from the same file.</li>
<li>Display the contents of the file, field by field, in the console output (System.out)... except the password!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit two classes</li>
<li>Submit the UserRegistration model and the reader/writer</li>
<li>Only the reader/writer should have a main() method</li>
<li>You must use object I/O to perform the reading and writing.</li>
</ul>
