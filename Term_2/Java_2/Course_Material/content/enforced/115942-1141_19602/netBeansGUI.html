<a name="gui"><h3>NetBeans GUI Builder Tutorial</h3></a>

<p>Netbeans includes a special tool that can be used to develop
Swing GUI interfaces.  This "GUI Builder" can help you to design
complex layouts without having to worry about nested layout managers.
It helps to understand how to use JPanel controls and how layout
managers work, but the GUI Builder makes interface design
less tedious and cumbersome.</p>

<p>You will be going through a tutorial on the Netbeans web site
that teaches you how to work with the GUI Builder.  You will
need to make note of the following things:</p>

<ul class="outer">
    <li>What is the Palette Window for?
    <li>What is the Properties Window?  What are Properties?
    <li>What does the Inspector window show you?  What happens if you click
    an item in the Inspector Window?</li>
    <li>How do you view the source code behind your GUI?</li>
    <li>How do you change the Font or Border of a component?</li>
    <li>How do you change the text of a component?</li>
    <li>How do you quickly add multiple occurrences of the same component?</li>
    <li>What happens when you "drop" a component over another component?
    What if you drop it over two other components?</li>
    <li>What are these buttons for?  <img src="images/nbButtons1.jpg"></li>
    <li>What are the "resizability behavior" buttons/menu items/properties for?
    What effect does this have on a component?</li>
    <li>How do you add a radio button group to a GUI?</li>
    <li>How can you preview your GUI without running the program?</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are some things that the tutorial doesn't cover that you
should try:</p>
<ul class="outer">
    <li>To change the title text of the JFrame's title bar, use the <b>title</b> property.</li>
    <li>The code generated by the GUI doesn't use appropriate variable names for the
    different components.  Make sure you always change your variable names:</li>
    <ul class="inner"><li>Right click the component and select <b>Change Variable Name</b></li>
    <li>Enter the desired name and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
    <li>If you examine the code generated by Netbeans, you'll see that all occurrences
    of this component's name have been changed.</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>Here's the tutorial (<b>stop at the section <i>Deploying GUI Applications</i>;
we'll go through this later in the course</b>):</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> You may be asked by your professor to show your finished program
as a "check off" assignment during class.</p>
