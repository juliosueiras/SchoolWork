<p>The following exercises will help you get back into Java mode.  You may need 
to go back to <a href="../prog10082">PROG10082</a> and look up anything you've 
forgotten.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> A program asks the user to enter their credit card balance and the 
card's monthly interest rate.  The program should then display the minimum payment 
and new balance for the next 12 months, assuming the minimum payment is made each 
month.  The minimum payment is 3% of the balance or $10.00, whichever is greater. Interest
is calculated on the entire balance at the end of the month, before the minimum payment
comes off.  This program should be done on the console.  Sample interaction and output might 
be:</p>

<pre>Enter credit card balance: 200
Enter interest rate: 15.5

        Min.Pmt      New Balance
---------------------------------
  1:    10.00          221.00
  2:    10.00          245.26
  3:    10.00          273.27
  4:    10.00          305.63
  5:    10.59          342.41
  6:    11.86          383.62
  7:    13.29          429.79
  8:    14.89          481.51
  9:    16.68          539.46
 10:    18.69          604.38
 11:    20.94          677.12
 12:    23.46          758.61

<p><b>2.</b> A program needs to be written to play a trivia game.  
One of the classes being used is the TFQuestion class, which models a true-false 
question.  This class has the following specs:</p>

<ul class="outer">
	<li>Attributes:
		<ul class="inner"><li>questionId - an integer that must be greater than 0 and represents a unique id number for each question.
		<li>questionText - a String that represents the question text for this question.  This attribute must have a value and can't be a null-string.
		<li>answer - a boolean that stores the answer to the question - true or false.
		</ul>
	<li>Methods:
		<ul class="inner"><li>TFQuestion(int questionId, String questionText, boolean answer) - a constructor that accepts and sets each of the attributes.
		<li>Accessor/Mutator methods for each attribute.
		<li>boolean isCorrect(boolean guess) - this method accepts a boolean value representing the user's guess.  If the guess is correct, the method returns true.  If the guess is incorrect, the method returns false.
		<li>String toString() - returns a String representation of the multiple-choice question.  This should show only the question I.D. and the question text formatted in the following way:
<pre>#XXX:  True / False :  This is the question text for this question.</pre>
		</ul>
	<li>Exceptions - mutator methods throw an IllegalArgumentException (with appropriate error message strings) if a field value is invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Write a test class to test your TFQuestion class.  Create a question, display 
the question on the screen, ask for the user's guess, and check the guess for the 
correct answer.  Use console input for this program.</p>
