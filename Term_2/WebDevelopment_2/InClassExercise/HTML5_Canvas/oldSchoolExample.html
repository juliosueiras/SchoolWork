<!--
An exercise that mimics Pac-Man moving around a small section of the maze.
of a game board.

Extra exercises:
- Make Pac-Man close his mouth whenever he eats a pellet
- Convert Pac-Man to Ms. Pac-Man by adding a pink bow on her head
- Add another button called "Run Away" that when clicked, calls the function 
runAway(), which moves Pac-Man in the reverse direction and down the path of 
the remaining pellets
- Add a ghost that trails Pac-Man when your runAway() function is invoked
- Experiment with different maze sections
